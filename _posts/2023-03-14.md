Decision makers regularly have to act without complete observation of the system they are working on.
A medical doctor chooses a treatment based on his observations without full knowledge of the patient.
When we try to get out of a maze, we do not have a map of the maze but must take a decision based on take on what we have observed.
Start-upers build their products a partial understanding of the market.
Modern airplanes are equipped with sensors: We can recorder their signals.

Beliefs +  

For clarity, let us consider the job of a decision maker that wants to control such a partially observed system.
At every timestep $t$, the decision maker does not know the state $x_t$ but only has access to observations $o_t$. He then takes a decision $u_t$ which influences the system, and the system evolves toward its state $x_{t+1}$.
