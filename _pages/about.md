I am a researcher and professor at École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées, where I founded and currently hold the Chair in Artificial Intelligence for Air Transport in partnership with Air France.

My research operates at the intersection of Operations Research and Machine Learning. I develop theoretical frameworks and practically efficient algorithms for data-driven combinatorial optimization problems. I place a strong emphasis on industrial applications, particularly in the fields of air transportation, supply chain management, and predictive maintenance.

In 2017, I received the dissertation award from the French Agency for Mathematics in Interaction with Business and Society (AMIES). More recently, I was awarded the **Robert Faure Prize**, presented triennially by the French Society of Operations Research (ROADEF) to a researcher under 35 for outstanding contributions to the field. I also coordinate the Data, Machine Learning, and Optimization axis of the [French Operations Research group](http://gdrro.lip6.fr/?q=node/239).

Recently, my research has increasingly focused on **Combinatorial Optimization Augmented Machine Learning**. The following [tutorial and survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10583) or these [slides](../assets/pdf/RecentTrendsInCOAML.pdf) provide a comprehensive introduction to this field.
