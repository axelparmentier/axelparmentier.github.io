I am a researcher and associate professor at Ecole des Ponts since 2016, where I have founded and hold the artificial intelligence for air transport chair with Air France. 

My research lies at the interplay of operations research and machine learning. I develop theoretical results and practically efficient algorithms for data-driven combinatorial optimization problems. I have a strong taste for industrial applications, notably in the fields of air transportation, supply chain, and predictive maintenance. 

In 2017, I won the dissertation award of the French agency for mathematics in interaction with business and society (AMIES), which rewards a contribution in applied mathematics with industrial applications. I recently received the Robert Faure price, which is awarded every three years by the French society of operations research (ROADEF) to a researcher under 35 for his contributions to the field. I animate the data, machine learning, and optimization axis of the [French Operations Research group](http://gdrro.lip6.fr/?q=node/239).
