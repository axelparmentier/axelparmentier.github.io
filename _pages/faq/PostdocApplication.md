## Doing a postdoc in my group

I am always open to outstanding candidates who are passionate about research.

When seeking a postdoc, the best choice is for a position where you will learn something different from what you learned during your PhD. In my group, you will have access to an ecosystem that is exceptional in

- combinatorial optimization augmented machine learning 
- decision aware learning 
- data driven optimization
- large scale operations research applications in the industry (may interest young colleagues who did a theoretical PhD and want to switch to the industry)

If you make it to a position and work well, I will be committed to helping you find a permanent position and boost your academic career (especially if you start your career in France or Europe).

## Applying for a postdoc

Before applying, please inform yourself on what we do and how we work:  

- spend time reading the research part of this website, 
- read a few publications
- come discussing with me at a conference if you have the opportunity

If you are even more motivated after this, then send an application with the following items

- motivation letter (customized for my research)
- curriculum vitae 
- research statement (max 1 page)
- 2 publications reflecting your research
- open source project you did (if in line with your research statement)
- 2 reference letters.

I receive many postdoc applications and try to respond to all of them. If you do not receive a reply within two weeks after reaching out, I apologize for the impoliteness, but it is unlikely that you receive a positive response afterwards. I will not reply to incomplete applications.

## Interview

If you make it to an interview, be aware that I will test you extensively on the skills needed for a postdoc.

- Come with slides for a 15 minutes talk.
- I will also ask you a research question related to the postdoc topic, and spend time working with you on it.

## After the interview

In case I give a positive response after the interview, I strongly encourage you to call [some of my postdocs](/students/), to have feedbacks on how it is to work with me.
