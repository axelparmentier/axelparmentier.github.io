École des Ponts is one of the most selective engineering school ("grande école") in France and is home to many exceptional students.
Here is how to recruit intern from École des Ponts / propose research projects on topics related to Operations Research.

For projects, please directly email the department (see below).

Students from École des Ponts do two kinds of internships

- Gap year internships (4 to 6 months) between the first and second years of their master's program. There is more flexibility regarding the topic.
    - Send an offer in February / September for an internship beginning in June / January
- Master's degree / End of studies internships (require strong scientific content if in a Master's program).
    - Send an offer in October for an internship beginning around April

Students from two departments have notable skills in Operations Research.

- Students from the [Industrial Engineering department](https://ecoledesponts.fr/en/industrial-engineering). They have a strong background in math, as well as a generalist training in industrial engineering. They may be the best candidates if your internship does not involve new scientific contributions, but rather understanding the industrial need, modeling it, and making the algorithm work. 
- Students from the [Applied Mathematics and Computer Science department](https://ecoledesponts.fr/en/applied-mathematics-and-computer-science) and the [Paris Master of Operations Research](https://uma.ensta-paris.fr/mpro/master2). They have an exceptional background in math and computer science as well as an engineering culture. They are the best candidates if you need someone to design a challenging algorithm. Please note that the department/master's program will refuse the internship if the scientific aspects are not sufficient.

You can directly email the departments to submit your offer. 
Please email me only if your internship is specially related to Operations Research. I can forward your offer to my students if the offer is related to my lectures.
