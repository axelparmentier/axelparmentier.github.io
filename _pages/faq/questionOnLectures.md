## ... one of your lectures

Please proceed in the following order

1. Look at the textbook (if any)
2. Look at the slides (if any)
3. Check on Educnet or teams (if at École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées)
4. Check the emails sent to the group

If the answer was nowhere

5. Write an email to your group teacher. If necessary the associate will follow your question to me.
6. If I am your group teacher, ask me the question in person at the next session (at the pause of the next session). 
If it cannot wait for the next session, then email me, but be aware that I may take a long time to respond.

## ... my grade at an exam 

1. Ask for your paper to the department assistant. 
2. If after that, you are absolutely certain that you deserve a better grade, then email your group teacher. 

Be aware that I correct in a way that advantages the students. But if you bother me, I will correct your exam again in a very detailed way. I can tell you that there are two cases

- either I didn't see one of your paper. In which case you of course get a better grade,
- or in 99% of the cases you end up with a lower grade, because I figure our that certain responses I trusted are false.
