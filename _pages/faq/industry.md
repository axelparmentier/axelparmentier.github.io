Operations Research is highly relevant for optimizing processes across many industries. My group has notably conducted research in

- Transportation, 
- Supply Chain,
- Revenue Management,
- Manufacturing,
- Predictive Maintenance,

and I provide advice to companies in

- Energy,
- Healthcare,
- Drug development.

As detailed on my [research](/research/) page and in this [blog post](/blog/2024/ORmodern/), I have a strong preference for applying these concepts to industry. Our algorithms often go into production and have received [awards](/cv/) for excellence in practice.

I am always happy to discover new industries and discuss with practitioners (OR experts, industrial directors, research directors, etc.) about

- identifying opportunities to apply AI to optimize industrial processes,
- technical difficulties on current projects,
- building the algorithmic architecture of new projects,
- building the next generation of algorithms.

Please email me if you are interested in such a discussion.
However, I receive many such solicitations and days have only 24 hours. Please excuse me if I cannot follow up. I will be more likely to accept a first encounter if you propose

- a lunch near the 12th arrondissement of Paris,
- a phone call for 18:00 to 18:20 CET on a weekday (except Friday).

When working with the industry, we generally adhere to the following steps

1. a first encounter to evaluate if there is potential for collaboration
2. a 5 to 10 day study to model the problem, evaluate the potential for research, and design algorithms
3. Depending on the conclusions of the study
    - If there is no need for research, we recommend "off-the-shelf algorithms" to your internal team and answer any technical questions that may arise. If you don't have such a team, you may consider recruiting an intern from Ã‰cole des Ponts.
    - If there is a need for research, then we can collaborate and consider recruiting an intern or a PhD student. 

This is how all our [long term partnerships](/research/) with the industry started.
