I only write recommendation letters for students that I know personally. 
I give my opinion frankly in recommendation letters, and therefore *refuse to write recommendation letters for students who did not rank in the first half of the class*. The only exception I do is for students who have a special curriculum which makes my course more challenging, because I then have a good story to tell in the letter.

Please email me with your request containing

- where you apply,
- a deadline,
- any information relevant to the application, e.g., 
    - what the university / employer seeks /values,
    - details about the curriculum you want to follow / position you want to obtain,
- my courses you followed and the grades you obtained (if any),
- your ranking at the KIRO (École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées' hackathon),
- any other relevant information I should include.

If I was not your group teacher, then

- if your group teacher is a professor, ask him/her directly to write you a letter;
- if he/she is a PhD student, than send me the request above with your group teacher in CC.
