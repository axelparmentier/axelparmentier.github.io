If you are one of my former student at Ecole de Ponts, and you would like to do a PhD in RO, then this page details how I can help you.
If you want to join my group, please read [this post](/faq/PhDapplication/). 

## OR in academia

There are basically three kinds of PhD in academia.

- *On an application, usually with an industrial partner*. Generally a CIFRE.
- *Methodological*. You want to prove theorems to build new algorithms that work well in practice, and implement these algorithms.
- *Theoretical*. You want to prove theorems.

## Where to find PhD offers 

PhD offers in France are available

- On the forum of the [Roadef](https://www.roadef.org/societe-francaise-recherche-operationnelle-aide-decision), the French Operations Research society.
- Posted on the mailing list of the [GDR ROD](http://gdrro.lip6.fr/?q=node/24)

and on all the usual venues for finding a job. Abroad, offers are generally available on math/computer science departments PhD programs.

## How I can help you

I try to help every student of Ã‰cole des Ponts who wants to do a PhD in OR - and worked reasonably hard on my lectures !

Please write me an email **structured as follows**

1. *What do you want to do after the PhD?* Even if you have not much idea, try to describe write concisely the different options you would be interested in
2. *What kind of PhD do you want to do?*. See above and try to be precise.
3. *Where do you want to do an internship?*
    - If in partnership with the industry, you can find a list of the OR teams in France on the [Roadef](https://www.roadef.org/societe-francaise-recherche-operationnelle-aide-decision) website. If you have no specific preference, I will send you to colleagues who do great work and told me they seek an intern.
    - If in academia, tell me where you would like to go. I generally send students to Italy, UK, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, US. But if you have a specific country in mind, tell me, I may have a contact.
4. Remind me everything that can motivate me to help you (good grades, ranking at the KIRO, etc.)

Then, 
- come discussing with me at the pause of the next session of the course.
- If you are not following a course at the moment, tell me on which days (Monday to Thursday) in the coming weeks I can call you between 18:00 and 18:20, and give me a phone number where I can join you. 

I will answer you with a few opportunities. Respond me with the one you prefer. Then

- Write an email with a letter of motivation (in the email) and a CV (attached) to the contact I give you, and put me in CC,
- I will respond (without you in CC) to push your application.
