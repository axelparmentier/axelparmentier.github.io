Operations Research is very relevant to many startup business models.
If you are building your startup and want advice on how to use AI optimize your industrial process, please email me. I am a scientific advisor for several startups and have helped others build the architecture of their decision support tools, particularly in the field of AI for

- Transportation, 
- Supply Chain,
- Revenue Management,
- Manufacturing,
- Predictive Maintenance
- Energy,
- Healthcare,
- Drug development.

Please note that I receive many such requests and cannot organize a meeting or respond positively to all of them.
However, I will do my best to respond, especially if the startup is based in France or involves former students of Ã‰cole des Ponts.
I am more likely to accept a first meeting if you propose

- a lunch near the 12th arrondissement of Paris,
- a phone call for 18:00 to 18:20 CET on a weekday (except Friday).
