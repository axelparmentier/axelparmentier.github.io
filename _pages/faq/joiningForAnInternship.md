If you are a student at

- École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées seeking a gap year internship,
- École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées or MPRO seeking a M2 internship,
- Ecole Polytechnique seeking a 3A research internship,

then directly write me an email with

- a motivation letter in the core of your email explaining 
    1. What interests you in our research,
    2. Why you feel qualified for joining the group,
    3. What you would like to do,
- a CV,
- a transcript of your grades,
- reference letters (if any).

If you are one of my student, please be aware that I attach utmost importance to the grades you obtained in my exams, and how well you performed on the KIRO (École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées Operations Research Hackahton).

I do not accept external internship applications, except if they come through colleagues I already know.
