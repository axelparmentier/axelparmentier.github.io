that maximize her profit from the remaining items. In knapsack interdiction, both decision-makers face different budget constraints. We propose a single-level approximation of the leader-follower problem, and interpret it as a combinatorial optimization layer in a machine learning pipeline. The ML pipeline includes a Generalized Linear Model as the first layer, which predicts the parameters of the single-level problem. Using a perturbation approach, we regularize the single-level problem, which enables to make it differentiable and provides a natural loss to train the model. Once trained, the pipeline provides effective ordering heuristics to solve Knapsack Interdiction problems.

We introduce the Shipper Transportation Design Problem, which integrates consolidation, routing, and regularity constraints, and propose a tailored Iterated Local Search (ILS) metaheuristic. The algorithm combines large-neighborhood search with MILP-based perturbations and exploits bundle-specific decompositions and giant container bounds to obtain scalable lower bounds and effective benchmarks. Computational experiments on real industrial data show that the ILS achieves an average gap of 7.9% to the best available lower bound on world-scale instances with more than 700,000 commodities and 1,200,000 arcs, delivering solutions showing a potential of 23.2% cost reduction compared to the Renault-based benchmark. To our knowledge, this is the first approach to solve shipper-side transportation design problems at such scale. Our analysis further yields managerial insights: accurate bin-packing models are essential for realistic consolidation, highly regular plans offer the best balance between cost and operational stability, and outsourcing is only attractive in low-volume contexts, while large-scale networks benefit from in-house planning.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Preprint</abbr></div> <div id="meunier2025aircraftroutingperiodicitycomplexity" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Aircraft routing: periodicity and complexity</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://cermics.enpc.fr/~meuniefr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frédéric Meunier</a>, <em>Axel Parmentier</em>, and Nour ElHouda Tellache</div> <div class="periodical"> Aug 2025 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05532" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The aircraft routing problem is one of the most studied problems of operations research applied to aircraft management. It involves assigning flights to aircraft while ensuring regular visits to maintenance bases. This paper examines two aspects of the problem. First, we explore the relationship between periodic instances, where flights are the same every day, and periodic solutions. The literature has implicitly assumed-without discussion-that periodic instances necessitate periodic solutions, and even periodic solutions in a stronger form, where every two airplanes perform either the exact same cyclic sequence of flights, or completely disjoint cyclic sequences. However, enforcing such periodicity may eliminate feasible solutions. We prove that, when regular maintenance is required at most every four days, there always exist periodic solutions of this form. Second, we consider the computational hardness of the problem. Even if many papers in this area refer to the NP-hardness of the aircraft routing problem, such a result is only available in the literature for periodic instances. We establish its NP-hardness for a non-periodic version. Polynomiality of a special but natural case is also proven.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Article</abbr></div> <div id="parmentierLearningStructuredApproximations2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Learning Structured Approximations of Combinatorial Optimization Problems</div> <div class="author"> <em>Axel Parmentier</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Open Journal Of Mathematical Optimization, in press</em> Jun 2025 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04323" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv</a> <a href="https://github.com/axelparmentier/MaximumWeightTwoStageSpanningTree.jl" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Machine learning pipelines that include a combinatorial optimization layer can give surprisingly efficient heuristics for difficult combinatorial optimization problems. Three questions remain open: which architecture should be used, how should the parameters of the machine learning model be learned, and what performance guarantees can we expect from the resulting algorithms? Following the intuitions of geometric deep learning, we explain why equivariant layers should be used when designing such pipelines, and illustrate how to build such layers on routing, scheduling, and network design applications. We introduce a learning approach that enables to learn such pipelines when the training set contains only instances of the difficult optimization problem and not their optimal solutions, and show its numerical performance on our three applications. Finally, using tools from statistical learning theory, we prove a theorem showing the convergence speed of the estimator. As a corollary, we obtain that, if an approximation algorithm can be encoded by the pipeline for some parametrization, then the learned pipeline will retain the approximation ratio guarantee. On our network design problem, our machine learning pipeline has the approximation ratio guarantee of the best approximation algorithm known and the numerical efficiency of the best heuristic.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Article</abbr></div> <div id="jungelLearningBasedOnlineOptimization2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Learning-Based Online Optimization for Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand Fleet Control</div> <div class="author"> Kai Jungel, <em>Axel Parmentier</em>, <a href="https://www.ot.mgt.tum.de/osm/team/maximilian-schiffer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maximilian Schiffer</a>, and <a href="https://w1.cirrelt.ca/~vidalt/en/home-thibaut-vidal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thibaut Vidal</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>INFORMS Journal on Computing</em> Jun 2025 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03963" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv</a> <a href="https://github.com/INFORMSJoC/2024.0637" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> <span><a href="http://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.2024.0637" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOI</a></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Autonomous mobility-on-demand systems are a viable alternative to mitigate many transportation-related externalities in cities, such as rising vehicle volumes in urban areas and transportation-related pollution.

We test our hybrid pipeline on large-scale real-world scenarios with different vehicle fleet sizes and various request densities.

Traditional methods often fail to leverage contextual information, which underscores the necessity for new algorithms. In this study, we utilize neural networks with combinatorial optimization layers to encode policies. Our goal is to minimize the empirical risk, which is estimated from past data on uncertain parameters and contexts. To that end, we present a surrogate learning problem and a generic primal-dual algorithm that is applicable to various combinatorial settings in stochastic optimization. Our approach extends classic Fenchel-Young loss results and introduces a new regularization method using sparse perturbations on the distribution simplex. This allows for tractable updates in the original space and can accommodate diverse objective functions. We demonstrate the linear convergence of our algorithm under certain conditions and provide a bound on the non-optimality of the resulting policy in terms of the empirical risk. Experiments on a contextual stochastic minimum weight spanning tree problem show that our algorithm is efficient and scalable, achieving performance comparable to imitation learning of solutions computed using an expensive Lagrangian-based heuristic.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Preprint</abbr></div> <div id="vivier-ardissonLearningLocalSearch2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Learning with Local Search MCMC Layers</div> <div class="author"> Germain Vivier-Ardisson, Mathieu Blondel, and <em>Axel Parmentier</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> May 2025 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14240" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv</a> <span><a href="http://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.14240" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOI</a></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Integrating combinatorial optimization layers into neural networks has recently attracted significant research interest. However, many existing approaches lack theoretical guarantees or fail to perform adequately when relying on inexact solvers. This is a critical limitation, as many operations research problems are NP-hard, often necessitating the use of neighborhood-based local search heuristics. These heuristics iteratively generate and evaluate candidate solutions based on an acceptance rule. In this paper, we introduce a theoretically-principled approach for learning with such inexact combinatorial solvers. Inspired by the connection between simulated annealing and Metropolis-Hastings, we propose to transform problem-specific neighborhood systems used in local search heuristics into proposal distributions, implementing MCMC on the combinatorial space of feasible solutions. This allows us to construct differentiable combinatorial layers and associated loss functions. Replacing an exact solver by a local search strongly reduces the computational burden of learning on many applications.

However, the success of an on-demand platform that utilizes crowdsourcing relies on finding a compensation policy that strikes a balance between creating attractive offers for gig workers and ensuring profitability. In this work, we examine a dynamic pricing problem for an on-demand platform that sets request-specific compensation of gig workers in a discrete-time framework, where requests and workers arrive stochastically. The operator’s goal is to determine a compensation policy that maximizes the total expected reward over the time horizon. Our approach introduces compensation strategies that explicitly account for gig worker request preferences. To achieve this, we employ the Multinomial Logit model to represent the acceptance probabilities of gig workers, and, as a result, derive an analytical solution that utilizes post-decision states. Subsequently, we integrate this solution into an approximate dynamic programming algorithm. We compare our algorithm against benchmark algorithms, including formula-based policies and an upper bound provided by the full information linear programming solution. Our algorithm demonstrates consistent performance across diverse settings, achieving improvements of at least 2.5-7.5% in homogeneous gig worker populations and 9% in heterogeneous populations over benchmarks, based on fully synthetic data. For real-world data, it surpasses benchmarks by 8% in weak and 20% in strong location preference scenarios.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Proceedings</abbr></div> <div id="ahmedDistrictNetDecisionawareLearning2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">DistrictNet: Decision-aware Learning for Geographical Districting</div> <div class="author"> Cheikh Ahmed, Alexandre Forel, <em>Axel Parmentier</em>, and <a href="https://w1.cirrelt.ca/~vidalt/en/home-thibaut-vidal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thibaut Vidal</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems</em> Nov 2024 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08287" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv</a> <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=njwYBFau8E" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/cheikh025/DistrictNet" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Districting is a complex combinatorial problem that consists in partitioning a geographical area into small districts.

Such approaches train policies that chain a statistical model with a surrogate combinatorial optimization oracle to map any instance of the problem to a feasible solution. The key idea is to exploit the statistical distribution over instances instead of dealing with instances separately. However learning such policies by risk minimization is challenging because the empirical risk is piecewise constant in the parameters, and few theoretical guarantees have been provided so far. In this article, we investigate methods that smooth the risk by perturbing the policy, which eases optimization and improves generalization. Our main contribution is a generalization bound that controls the perturbation bias, the statistical learning error, and the optimization error. Our analysis relies on the introduction of a uniform weak property, which captures and quantifies the interplay of the statistical model and the surrogate combinatorial optimization oracle.

Yet, these pipelines lack interpretability since they are made of two opaque layers: a highly non-linear prediction model, such as a deep neural network, and an optimization layer, which is typically a complex black-box solver. Our goal is to improve the transparency of such methods by providing counterfactual explanations. We build upon variational autoencoders a principled way of obtaining counterfactuals: working in the latent space leads to a natural notion of plausibility of explanations. We finally introduce a variant of the classic loss for VAE training that improves their performance in our specific structured context. These provide the foundations of CF-OPT, a first-order optimization algorithm that can find counterfactual explanations for a broad class of structured learning architectures. Our numerical results show that both close and plausible explanations can be obtained for problems from the recent literature.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Proceedings</abbr></div> <div id="demelas2023predicting" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Predicting Accurate Lagrangian Multipliers for Mixed Integer Linear Programs</div> <div class="author"> Francesco Demelas, Joseph Le Roux, Mathieu Lacroix, and <em>Axel Parmentier</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Accepted at the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning</em> Jul 2024 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14659" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Lagrangian relaxation stands among the most efficient approaches for solving a Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILP) with difficult constraints. Given any duals for these constraints, called Lagrangian Multipliers (LMs), it returns a bound on the optimal value of the MILP, and Lagrangian methods seek the LMs giving the best such bound. But these methods generally rely on iterative algorithms resembling gradient descent to maximize the concave piecewise linear dual function: the computational burden grows quickly with the number of relaxed constraints. We introduce a deep learning approach that bypasses the descent, effectively amortizing the local, per instance, optimization. A probabilistic encoder based on a graph convolutional network computes high-dimensional representations of relaxed constraints in MILP instances. A decoder then turns these representations into LMs. We train the encoder and decoder jointly by directly optimizing the bound obtained from the predicted multipliers. Numerical experiments show that our approach closes up to 85~\% of the gap between the continuous relaxation and the best Lagrangian bound, and provides a high quality warm-start for descent based Lagrangian methods.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Proceedings</abbr></div> <div id="forelDonExplainNoise2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Don’t Explain Noise: Robust Counterfactuals for Randomized Ensembles</div> <div class="author"> Alexandre Forel, <em>Axel Parmentier</em>, and <a href="https://w1.cirrelt.ca/~vidalt/en/home-thibaut-vidal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thibaut Vidal</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Proceedings of 21st International Conference on the Integration of Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research Techniques in Constraint Programming (CPAIOR 2024)</em> May 2024 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14116" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv</a> <span><a href="http://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-60597-0_19" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOI</a></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Counterfactual explanations describe how to modify a feature vector in order to flip the outcome of a trained classifier.

We formalize the generation of robust counterfactual explanations as a probabilistic problem and show the link between the robustness of ensemble models and the robustness of base learners. We develop a practical method with good empirical performance and support it with theoretical guarantees for ensembles of convex base learners. Our results show that existing methods give surprisingly low robustness: the validity of naive counterfactuals is below \50\% on most data sets and can fall to \20\% on problems with many features.

In this system, the pilots bid on the different activities and the schedules that lexicographically maximize the scores of the pilots according to their seniority are selected. A sequential approach to solve this maximization problem is natural: The problem is first solved with the bids of the most senior pilot, and then it is solved with those of the second most senior without decreasing the score of the most senior, and so on. The literature admits that the structure of the problem somehow imposes such an approach. The problem can be modeled as an integer linear lexicographic program. We propose a new efficient method, which relies on column generation for solving its continuous relaxation and returns proven optimality gaps. To design this column generation, we prove that bounded linear lexicographic programs admit “primal-dual” feasible bases, and we show how to compute such bases efficiently. Another contribution on which our method relies is the extension of standard tools for resource-constrained longest path problems to their lexicographic versions. This is useful in our context because the generation of new columns is modeled as a lexicographic resource-constrained longest path problem. Numerical experiments show that this new method is already able to solve to proven optimality industrial instances provided by Air France, with up to 150 pilots. By adding a last ingredient in the resolution of the longest path problems, which exploits the specificity of the preferential bidding system, the method achieves for these instances computational times that are compatible with operational constraints.

Existing multi-stage stochastic optimization approaches that allow to solve the underlying dynamic vehicle routing problem are either computationally too expensive for an application in online settings, or – in the case of reinforcement learning – struggle to perform well on high-dimensional combinatorial problems. To mitigate these drawbacks, we propose a novel machine learning pipeline that incorporates a combinatorial optimization layer. We apply this general pipeline to a dynamic vehicle routing problem with dispatching waves, which was recently promoted in the EURO Meets NeurIPS Vehicle Routing Competition at NeurIPS 2022. Our methodology ranked first in this competition, outperforming all other approaches in solving the proposed dynamic vehicle routing problem. With this work, we provide a comprehensive numerical study that further highlights the efficacy and benefits of the proposed pipeline beyond the results achieved in the competition, e.g., by showcasing the robustness of the encoded policy against unseen instances and scenarios.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Article</abbr></div> <div id="bouvierSolvingContinentScaleInventory2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Solving a Continent-Scale Inventory Routing Problem at Renault</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://louisbouvier.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Louis Bouvier</a>, <a href="https://gdalle.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guillaume Dalle</a>, <em>Axel Parmentier</em>, and <a href="https://w1.cirrelt.ca/~vidalt/en/home-thibaut-vidal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thibaut Vidal</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Transportation Science</em> Jan 2024 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00412" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv</a> <a href="https://github.com/LouisBouvier/InventoryRoutingLNS.jl" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> <span><a href="http://doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2022.0342" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOI</a></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This paper is the fruit of a partnership with Renault. Their reverse logistic requires solving a continent-scale multiattribute inventory routing problem (IRP). With an average of 30 commodities, 16 depots, and 600 customers spread across a continent, our instances are orders of magnitude larger than those in the literature. Existing algorithms do not scale, so we propose a large neighborhood search (LNS). To make it work, (1) we generalize existing split delivery vehicle routing problems and IRP neighborhoods to this context, (2) we turn a state-of-the-art matheuristic for medium-scale IRP into a large neighborhood, and (3) we introduce two novel perturbations: the reinsertion of a customer and that of a commodity into the IRP solution. We also derive a new lower bound based on a flow relaxation. In order to stimulate the research on large-scale IRP, we introduce a library of industrial instances. We benchmark our algorithms on these instances and make our code open source. Extensive numerical experiments highlight the relevance of each component of our LNS.

Our purpose is to challenge this belief. We show that optimal memoryless policies can be computed efficiently using mixed integer linear programming (MILP), and perform reasonably well on a wide range of instances from the literature. When strengthened with valid inequalities, the linear relaxation of this MILP provides high quality upper-bounds on the value of an optimal history dependent policy. Furthermore, when used with a finite horizon POMDP problem with memoryless policies as rolling optimization problem, a model predictive control approach leads to an efficient history-dependent policy, which we call the short memory in the future (SMF) policy. Basically, the SMF policy leverages these memoryless policies to build an approximation of the Bellman value function.

Among these, the efficient planning of an electric fleet to fulfill passenger transportation requests still represents a major challenge. This is because of the specific constraints of electric vehicles, bound by their battery autonomy and necessity of recharge planning, and the large scale of the operations, which challenges existing optimization algorithms. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a scalable column generation approach for routing and scheduling in this context. Our algorithm relies on four main ingredients: (i) a multigraph reformulation of the problem based on a characterization of nondominated charging arcs, (ii) an efficient bidirectional pricing algorithm using tight backward bounds, (iii) sparsification approaches permitting to decrease the size of the subjacent graphs dramatically, and (iv) a diving heuristic, which locates near-optimal solutions in a fraction of the time needed for a complete branch-and-price. Through extensive computational experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous algorithms for this setting, leading to accurate solutions for problems counting several hundreds of requests.

First, the solution of a CO problem often behaves as a piecewise constant function of its objective parameters. Given that ML pipelines are typically trained using stochastic gradient descent, the absence of slope information is very detrimental. Second, standard ML losses do not work well in combinatorial settings. A growing body of research addresses these challenges through diverse methods. Unfortunately, the lack of well-maintained implementations slows down the adoption of CO layers. In this paper, building upon previous works, we introduce a probabilistic perspective on CO layers, which lends itself naturally to approximate differentiation and the construction of structured losses. We recover many approaches from the literature as special cases, and we also derive new ones. Based on this unifying perspective, we present InferOpt.jl, an open-source Julia package that 1) allows turning any CO oracle with a linear objective into a differentiable layer, and 2) defines adequate losses to train pipelines containing such layers. Our library works with arbitrary optimization algorithms, and it is fully compatible with Julia’s ML ecosystem.

The absence of guarantees of performance and robustness hinders trustworthiness. In this paper, we take a disciplined approach towards counterfactual explanations for tree ensembles. We advocate for a model-based search aiming at "optimal" explanations and propose efficient mixed-integer programming approaches. We show that isolation forests can be modeled within our framework to focus the search on plausible explanations with a low outlier score. We provide comprehensive coverage of additional constraints that model important objectives, heterogeneous data types, structural constraints on the feature space, along with resource and actionability restrictions. Our experimental analyses demonstrate that the proposed search approach requires a computational effort that is orders of magnitude smaller than previous mathematical programming algorithms. It scales up to large data sets and tree ensembles, where it provides, within seconds, systematic explanations grounded on well-defined models solved to optimality.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Article</abbr></div> <div id="parmentierLearningApproximateIndustrial2021a" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Learning to Approximate Industrial Problems by Operations Research Classic Problems</div> <div class="author"> <em>Axel Parmentier</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Operations Research</em> Apr 2021 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/suppl/10.1287/opre.2020.2094" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> <span><a href="http://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2020.2094" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOI</a></span> <span><a href="http://hal.inria.fr/hal-02396091" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HAL</a></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Practitioners of operations research often consider difficult variants of well-known optimization problems and struggle to find a good algorithm for their variants although decades of research have produced highly efficient algorithms for the well-known problems. We introduce a machine learning for operations research paradigm to build efficient heuristics for such variants: use a machine learning predictor to turn an instance of the variant into an instance of the well-known problem, then solve the instance of the well-known problem, and finally retrieve a solution of the variant from the solution of the well-known problem. This paradigm requires learning the predictor that transforms an instance of the variant into an instance of the well-known problem. We introduce a structured learning methodology to learn that predictor. We illustrate our paradigm and learning methodology on path problems. We, therefore, introduce a maximum likelihood approach to approximate an arbitrary path problem on an acyclic digraph by a usual shortest path problem. Because path problems play an important role as pricing subproblems of column-generation approaches, we introduce matheuristics that leverage our approximations in that context.

Such problems are difficult because of the partial observations, and because of the curse of dimensionality that appears when the number of components increases. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) have been introduced to deal with the first challenge, while weakly coupled stochastic dynamic programs address the second. Drawing from these two branches of the literature, we introduce the notion of weakly coupled POMDPs. The objective is to find a policy maximizing the total expected reward over a finite horizon. Our algorithms rely on two ingredients. The first, which can be used independently, is a mixed integer linear formulation for generic POMDPs that computes an optimal memoryless policy. The formulation is strengthened with valid cuts based on a probabilistic interpretation of the dependence between random variables, and its linear relaxation provide a practically tight upper bound on the value of an optimal history-dependent policies. The second is a collection of mathematical programming formulations and algorithms which provide tractable policies and upper bounds for weakly coupled POMDPs. Lagrangian relaxations, fluid approximations, and almost sure constraints relaxations enable to break the curse of dimensionality. We test our generic POMDPs formulations on benchmark instance forms the literature, and our weakly coupled POMDP algorithms on a maintenance problem.

More precisely, given random variables considered as vertices of an acyclic digraph, a probabilistic graphical model defines a joint distribution via the conditional distributions of vertices given their parents. In an ID, the random variables are represented by a probabilistic graphical model whose vertices are partitioned into three types: chance, decision, and utility vertices. The user chooses the distribution of the decision vertices conditionally to their parents in order to maximize the expected utility. Leveraging the notion of rooted junction tree, we present a mixed integer linear formulation for solving an ID, as well as valid inequalities, which lead to a computationally efficient algorithm.

We propose simple approaches to deal with Air France current setting. For routing, we introduce an exact compact IP formulation that can be solved to optimality by current MIP solvers in at most a few minutes even on Air France largest instances. Regarding crew pairing, we provide a methodology to model the column generation pricing subproblem within a new resource constrained shortest path framework recently introduced by the first author. This new framework, which can be used as a black-box, leverages on bounds to discard partial solutions and speed-up the resolution. The resulting approach enables to solve to optimality Air France largest instances. Recent literature has focused on integrating aircraft routing and crew pairing problems.

In airlines’ hubs, airlines generally choose to perform these jobs with their own agents. Shift planning aims at building the sequences of jobs operated by the airline agents and has been widely studied given its impact on operating costs. The impact of delayed flights is generally not taken into account despite the propagation of flight delays along these sequences: If a flight is late, then the agents doing the corresponding jobs are delayed, and may arrive late to their next jobs and delay the corresponding flights. Since delay costs are much higher than the costs of outsourcing jobs, if the agent who is supposed to operate a job is still working elsewhere when the job begins, then airlines tend to outsource the job to their own dedicated team or to a third party. We introduce a stochastic version of the shift-planning problem that takes into account outsourcing costs due to delay. It can be seen as a natural stochastic generalization of the vehicle-scheduling problem in which delayed jobs are outsourced. We propose a column-generation approach to solve it, whose key element is the pricing subproblem algorithm, modeled as a stochastic resource-constrained shortest-path problem. Numerical results on Air France industrial instances show the benefits of using our stochastic version of the shift-planning problem and the efficiency of the solution method. Moving to the stochastic version enables Air France to reduce total operating costs by 3.5%–4.8% on instances with more than 200 jobs, and our algorithm can solve to near optimality instances with up to 400 jobs.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Article</abbr></div> <div id="parmentierAlgorithmsNonlinearStochastic2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Algorithms for Non-Linear and Stochastic Resource Constrained Shortest Path</div> <div class="author"> <em>Axel Parmentier</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Mathematical Methods of Operations Research</em> Apr 2019 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07880" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv</a> <span><a href="http://doi.org/10.1007/s00186-018-0649-x" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOI</a></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Resource constrained shortest path problems are usually solved thanks to a smart enumeration of all the non-dominated paths. Recent improvements of these enumeration algorithms rely on the use of bounds on path resources to discard partial solutions. The quality of the bounds determines the performance of the algorithm. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a standard procedure to generate bounds on paths resources in a general setting which covers most resource constrained shortest path problems, among which stochastic versions. In that purpose, we introduce a generalization of the resource constrained shortest path problem where the resources are taken in a monoid. The resource of a path is the monoid sum of the resources of its arcs. The problem consists in finding a path whose resource minimizes a non-decreasing cost function of the path resource among the paths that respect a given constraint. Enumeration algorithms are generalized to this framework. We use lattice theory to provide polynomial procedures to find good quality bounds. These procedures solve a generalization of the algebraic path problem, where arc resources belong to a lattice ordered monoid. The practical efficiency of the approach is proved through an extensive numerical study on some deterministic and stochastic resource constrained shortest path problems.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Technical Report</abbr></div> <div id="cohenTwoGeneralizationsMarkov2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Two Generalizations of Markov Blankets</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://datascience.ch/team_member/victor-cohen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Victor Cohen</a>, and <em>Axel Parmentier</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> Mar 2019 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03538" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In a probabilistic graphical model on a set of variables \V the Markov blanket of a random vector \B is the minimal set of variables conditioned to which \B is independent from the remaining of the variables \V \backslash B\.

Partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are generalizations of MDPs where the decision maker has only partial information on the state of the system. Decomposable POMDPs are specific cases of POMDPs that enable one to model systems with several components. Such problems naturally model a wide range of applications such as predictive maintenance. Finding an optimal policy for a POMDP is PSPACE-hard and practically challenging. We introduce a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for POMDPs restricted to the policies that only depend on the current observation, as well as valid inequalities that are based on a probabilistic interpretation of the dependence between variables. The linear relaxation provides a good bound for the usual POMDPs where the policies depend on the full history of observations and actions. Solving decomposable POMDPs is especially challenging due to the curse of dimensionality. Leveraging our MILP formulation for POMDPs, we introduce a linear program based on “fluid formulation” for decomposable POMDPs, that provides both a bound on the optimal value and a practically efficient heuristic to find a good policy.

It is generally solved using a decomposition approach where demand constraints are relaxed, resulting in one pricing subproblem for each unit. In this paper we focus on the pricing subproblem for thermal units at EDF, a major French electricity producer. Our objective is to determine an optimal two-day production plan that minimizes the overall cost while respecting several non-linear operational constraints. The pricing problem is generally solved by dynamic programming. However, due to the curse of dimensionality, dynamic programming reaches its limits when extra-constraints have to be enforced. We model the subproblem as a resource constrained shortest path (RCSP) problem.

The traffic is differentiated by the destination (i.e. Lagrangian flow) and different flow groups are assumed to satisfy the first-in-first-out (FIFO) condition at each junction. The queuing in the network is assumed to be contained at each junction node and spill-back to the previous junction is ignored. We show that this model leads to a well-posed problem for computing the dynamics of the system and prove that the solution is unique through a mathematical derivation of the model properties. The framework is then used to analytically prescribe the delays at each junction of the network and across any sub-path, which is the main contribution of the article. This is a critical requirement when solving control and optimization problems over the network, such as system optimal network routing and solving for equilibrium behavior. In fact, the framework provides analytical expressions for the delay at any node or sub-path as a function of the inflow at any upstream node. Furthermore, the model can be solved numerically using a very simple and efficient feed forward algorithm. We demonstrate the versatility of the framework by applying it to two example networks, a single path of multiple bottlenecks and a diverge junction with complex junction dynamics.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Proceedings</abbr></div> <div id="kruberLearningWhenUse2017" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Learning When to Use a Decomposition</div> <div class="author"> Markus Kruber, <a href="https://www.or.rwth-aachen.de/en/details-staff/luebbecke.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marco E.

Recently, automating the process and embedding it in standard MIP solvers have been proposed, with the detection of a decomposable model structure as key element. If the detected structure reflects the (usually unknown) actual structure of the MIP well, the solver may be much faster on the reformulated model than on the original. Otherwise, the solver may completely fail. We propose a supervised learning approach to decide whether or not a reformulation should be applied, and which decomposition to choose when several are possible.

We study the use of incentives and tolls to manipulate the equilibrium departure times of the exiting vehicles and thereby mitigate the impact on through traffic.
