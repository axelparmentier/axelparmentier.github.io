</p> </header> <article class="post-content"> <p>Fifteen years ago, in the rigorous setting of a preparatory class <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, a friend challenged my perception of our studies. He argued that the mathematics we were delving into did not encompass his intellectual and spiritual <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> life. At the time, I disagreed, yet I found myself unable to articulate the connection I sensed between our mathematical endeavors and the broader intellectual realms.</p> <p>Today, as a professional applied mathematician, I have found the words that eluded me then. Mathematics, I have come to realize, is not just a tool for solving problems but a gateway to understanding other fields of knowledge. It is a source of joy that goes beyond the boundaries of professional work.</p> <p>This post is not a boastful declaration but an exploration of the satisfaction one can experience in the profession of mathematics. It is a description of the perks that come with being a mathematician. While describing what I enjoy in the job, I am aware of the potential for confirmation bias justifying my career choice. Yet, this self-awareness does not diminish the joy I find in my work.</p> <h2 id="mathematics-as-the-language-of-science">Mathematics as the language of science</h2> <p>In the realm of intellectual pursuits, applied mathematicians enjoy a perk that stems from their fluency in mathematics. Mathematics is not a science but the language of science and technology. It is this foundational role that bestows upon mathematicians a remarkable ability to delve into virtually any scientific theory or technical discipline <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Indeed, when we discuss with a scientist from another field, say for instance a biologist, we can manage to understand the problem they work on because we can understand the underlying mathematics of their models.</p> <p>In that, we perhaps inherit a small part of the universal thinkers of yesterday, who mastered disciplines from science to philosophy. Today, philosophy struggles to grasp the intricacies of science and technology, which are the driving forces behind the changes and transformations shaping our world. In contrast, mathematicians, should they exert the effort, are capable of understanding not only the sciences and technologies but also the writings of philosophers if they so desire. Well, perhaps not Heidegger. For the applied mathematician, life is not just a series of equations to be solved but a tapestry of knowledge to be woven into a comprehensive understanding of the universe we inhabit.</p> <h2 id="applied-mathematicians-modeling-the-world">Applied Mathematicians: Modeling the World</h2> <p>One of the key distinctions in the field of mathematics is between pure mathematicians and applied mathematicians. While pure mathematicians are driven by the intrinsic beauty and complexity of mathematics itself, applied mathematicians harness mathematical tools not to study mathematics for its own sake, but to model the world around us. This modeling approach is arguably the most advanced technique in human endeavors, allowing for a logical and effective understanding of the world, and the ability to construct tangible outcomes based on this understanding <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p> <p>Applied mathematicians are, therefore, not just scholars of abstract concepts; they are the architects of models that mirror reality. Their work translates into the design of systems, the optimization of processes, and the prediction of outcomes, which are essential in various industries and sectors. A perk of being an applied mathematician lies in the ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems, bridging the gap between the world of ideas and the world of human experience.</p> <h2 id="operational-research-and-economic-applications">Operational Research and economic applications</h2> <p>Operational research focuses modeling and optimizing economical and industrial processes. <a href="/blog/2024/ORmodern/">It applies the tools of applied mathematics to decode the economic world, and address socio-economic and ecological challenges</a>. Contrarily to economists, we do not want to debate on what should be the rules. Operational researchers use mathematical rigor to develop algorithms that take the best possible decisions effectively on a large scale given these rules. These algorithms are designed to capture the full complexity of real-world scenarios, providing more accurate and actionable insights.</p> <p>Therefore, the field of operational research exposes practitioners to a wide array of industrial sectors, offering a rich tapestry of professional interests and opportunities. This breadth of exposure allows operational researchers to discover and appreciate the nuances of numerous professions.</p> <h2 id="individual-simplicity-amidst-collective-wealth">Individual simplicity amidst collective wealth</h2> <p>I would like to conclude this post by a humorous tribute to the Jesuits schools where I had the chance to study. One of the general culture teacher, who was not a Jesuit but a conservative French intellectual, had the habit to say: “Jesuits understand everything to how to live a comfortable intellectual life. Indeed, they live a life of individual simplicity amidst collective wealth, enjoying the privileges of money without its burdens, nor the burdens of family”. François Varillon, a French Jesuit of the twentieth century, wrote one of the greatest satisfactions of Jesuit life is the intellectual friendships that are forged over decades.<br> Like the Jesuits, academics live a life of individual simplicity amidst a collective wealth of knowledge. We forge intellectual bonds, built upon shared curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge, which are the unseen treasures of our academic profession. Unlike the Jesuits, however, we also have the opportunity to enjoy family life. In the dance of family life, the rhythm of joy outsteps the small steps of daily duties.</p> <hr> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p><strong>Understanding the French ‘Classe Préparatoire’:</strong> In France, a ‘classe préparatoire’, often abbreviated as ‘prépa’, is a highly intensive and prestigious program that prepares high school graduates for entrance exams to ‘Grandes Écoles’. These are elite higher education institutions outside the mainstream framework of the public universities system. Classes préparatoires are known for their rigorous curriculum, which typically spans two years and covers advanced topics in science, humanities, or commerce. Students in these programs often undergo a demanding schedule with long hours of coursework, aiming to excel in competitive exams that grant access to schools in engineering, business, or other specialized fields. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p><strong>No mysticism, please !</strong> I would like to dispel three potential misunderstandings that could arise from my reflections. First, it is not my intention to present mathematics as a form of mysticism. Every math teacher has encountered among their students those who are zealots and mystics of mathematics, who tend not to be the best mathematicians. What I meant by spiritual is that we recognize an aesthetic in mathematical theories akin to the admiration one might feel for the beauty of art. And certainly not any kind of mystical belief. Secondly, it would be a mistake to believe that mathematics replaces religion. Even though I consider mathematics to be the most advanced form of human knowledge, it does not supplant others areas of knowledge when it comes to describing human experience. Mathematics is a powerful tool for understanding the world, but it does not claim to provide a comprehensive view of our experience of reality, nor does it fulfill the role that spiritual beliefs play in individuals’ lives. As Harvard’s theologian Harvey Cox points out in the introduction of <em>the future of faith</em>, there is joy in recognizing that previous generations faced the same questions about life’s mysteries – questions to which mathematics cannot provide answers. However, just as one can experience a sense of wonder at religious beauty, one can also feel awe at the beauty of ideas, and even more at the beauty of the world, a feeling that is enhanced by practicing mathematics and gaining a better understanding. The more we delve into mathematics, the more we understand it, and through its tools, the more we perceive the world. Yet, this deepening understanding also brings a profound realization of how little we actually know about the world and mathematics itself. It highlights the vast expanse of knowledge yet to be discovered and allows us to appreciate the beauty of these ideas and the world even more. This experience of beauty may be the scientists’ version of experiencing the transcendence ‘toward-which’ man tends discussed by theologians like Karl Rahner. Finally, mathematics should not be confused with religious practice. Harvard’s theologian Harvey Cox, in his book “The Market as God,” highlights how some economists treat their discipline as a theology. Thankfully, mathematicians do not fall into this trap. We do not claim to hold absolute truths as theologians might, nor to whisper in the ears of politicians, but rather work collectively to develop theories based on logic and reason. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:4"> <p>I definitely do not mean that mathematicians can talk as experts on matters of other fields. We unfortunately heard during COVID too many established scientists pretending to give a scientific opinion on something they are not expert of. This goes against scientific ethic. I just mean that we can understand enough of other sciences to take pleasure in this discovery, and sometimes to collaborate with experts of the field. <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:3"> <p>This perk is also enjoyed by Physicists, and other practitioners of hard mathematized sciences <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Axel Parmentier.
